    ### What's CVD?
    The heart is the muscular organ that pumps blood carrying oxygen and nutrients throughout the body with the help of the circulatory system (heart, blood and blood vessels).  
    
    Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels. 
    Some of them are: 
    - **Coronary heart disease**: Disease of blood vessels supplying the heart (Heart attack).
    - **Cerebrovascular disease**: Disease of blood vessels supplying the brain (Stroke).
    - **Peripheral arterial disease**: Disease of blood vessels supplying the arms and legs.
    - **Rheumatic heart disease**: Damage to the heart muscle and heart valves from rheumatic fever, caused by streptococcal bacteria.
    - **Congenital heart disease**: Birth defects that affect the normal development and functioning of the heart.
    - **Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism**: Blood clots in the leg veins, which can dislodge and move to the heart and lungs.
    
    According to the **World Health Organization (WHO)**, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death globally. The risk of suffering is higher in older people and increases with some preview pathologies like hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and smoking.

    st.write('''
    ### What are the risk factors?
    The most important risk factors of heart disease are having an unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use and drinking too much alcohol. Genetic factors play a role in high blood pressure and heart disease.
    - **Unhealthy diet**: Having a diet high in saturated fats, trans fat and cholesterol is linked to heart diseases, as well as eating too much salt which can raise the blood pressure.
    - **Physical inactivity**: It can increase the chances of high blood pressure, obesity, high cholesterol and diabetes, which are all risk factors. 
    - **Tobacco use**: Smoking can damage the heart and blood vessels; nicotine raises blood pressure and the carbon monoxide from cigarettes reduces the amount of oxygen that your blood can carry.
    - **Drinking too much alcohol**: It increases the levels of triglycerides, the fatty substance in the blood that increases the risk of heart disease.

They are at a higher risk of elevated both diastolic and systolic pressure, which are significant risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.

Implementing specific preventive and management strategies, such as regular health check-ups, lifestyle modifications, and stress management, is crucial for this group.

- Women:

While they tend to have lower diastolic and systolic pressure levels, continuous monitoring is essential to ensure early detection of any significant changes, especially during critical life stages like pregnancy or menopause.

Distribution of Values:

The graph likely shows a distribution where most values fall within the Normal or Elevated ranges, with fewer values in the Hypertension and Emergency categories.

However, if there is a significant number of values in the Hypertension or Emergency ranges, this would indicate a high prevalence of uncontrolled blood pressure in the population.

Health Implications:

A high number of values in the Hypertension ranges (Stage 1 and Stage 2) suggests a population at risk for cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and kidney problems.

A high number of values in the Emergency range would indicate a critical need for immediate medical interventions and public health campaigns.

This category represents critically low diastolic pressure levels requiring immediate medical attention.

    ### Key observations 2:
Distribution of Values:

The majority of values fall within the Normal range (13,916), suggesting that most of the population has healthy diastolic blood pressure levels.

A smaller number of values are in Hypotension (176) and Emergency (47) ranges, indicating a minor but significant portion of the population with low or critically low diastolic pressure.

Health Implications:

The presence of values in the Hypotension and Emergency ranges highlights the need for medical attention for those with abnormally low diastolic pressure, as it can lead to complications like organ damage or shock.

Intervention Strategies:

For individuals in the Low and Hypotension ranges, lifestyle adjustments such as increased fluid intake, dietary changes, and monitoring for symptoms like dizziness are important.

Individuals in the Emergency range require immediate medical intervention to stabilize their blood pressure and prevent further complications.

    - 0: Normal (no abnormality detected in the ECG at rest).
    - 1: ST-T wave abnormality (changes in the ST-T segment that may indicate ischemia).
    - 2: Left ventricular hypertrophy (enlargement of the left ventricle, often due to high blood pressure or heart disease).
‚Ä¢	Thalach (Maximum heart rate achieved): Refers to the highest heart rate achieved during a stress test or physical exertion. 
    
    - The value is expressed in beats per minute (bpm) and reflects how the heart responds to exercise. 
    A higher maximum heart rate can indicate better cardiovascular fitness, while a low maximum heart rate may signal potential heart issues.''')
