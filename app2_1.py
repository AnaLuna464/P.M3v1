    ### What's CVD?
    The heart is the muscular organ that pumps blood carrying oxygen and nutrients throughout the body with the help of the circulatory system (heart, blood and blood vessels).  
    
    Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels. 
    Some of them are: 
    - **Coronary heart disease**: Disease of blood vessels supplying the heart (Heart attack).
    - **Cerebrovascular disease**: Disease of blood vessels supplying the brain (Stroke).
    - **Peripheral arterial disease**: Disease of blood vessels supplying the arms and legs.
    - **Rheumatic heart disease**: Damage to the heart muscle and heart valves from rheumatic fever, caused by streptococcal bacteria.
    - **Congenital heart disease**: Birth defects that affect the normal development and functioning of the heart.
    - **Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism**: Blood clots in the leg veins, which can dislodge and move to the heart and lungs.
    
    According to the **World Health Organization (WHO)**, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death globally. The risk of suffering is higher in older people and increases with some preview pathologies like hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and smoking.

    # Introduction--> What are the risk factors?
    st.write('''
    ### What are the risk factors?
    The most important risk factors of heart disease are having an unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use and drinking too much alcohol. Genetic factors play a role in high blood pressure and heart disease.
    - **Unhealthy diet**: Having a diet high in saturated fats, trans fat and cholesterol is linked to heart diseases, as well as eating too much salt which can raise the blood pressure.
    - **Physical inactivity**: It can increase the chances of high blood pressure, obesity, high cholesterol and diabetes, which are all risk factors. 
    - **Tobacco use**: Smoking can damage the heart and blood vessels; nicotine raises blood pressure and the carbon monoxide from cigarettes reduces the amount of oxygen that your blood can carry.
    - **Drinking too much alcohol**: It increases the levels of triglycerides, the fatty substance in the blood that increases the risk of heart disease.

    - Pain or discomfort in the arms, neck, shoulder, jaw and back

    ## Objectives of the project 
    The objective of this project is to be able to inform society of the importance of cardiovascular diseases and to have an AI tool that can predict the probability of a person having a cardiovascular disease which is in the "Prediction Model" section. This tool will help the user to know if they are at risk of having a cardiovascular disease and give them some tips to prevent and take care of their health.
